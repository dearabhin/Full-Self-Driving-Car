# Advanced Rain Detection Sensor for Self-Driving Car

This C code demonstrates the implementation of an advanced rain detection sensor for a self-driving car. The code activates and deactivates the car's wipers based on the rain level detected by the sensor.

## Prerequisites

- Rain sensor hardware compatible with the provided rain sensor library.
- Rain sensor library that provides the necessary functions for initialization and reading the rain level.
- Wiper activation and deactivation functions compatible with the self-driving car's control system.

## Setup

1. Connect the rain sensor hardware to the appropriate ports of the self-driving car.
2. Install the rain sensor library according to the provided instructions.
3. Ensure that the wiper activation and deactivation functions are integrated with the car's control system.

## Usage

1. Include the rain sensor library and necessary headers in your C project.
2. Replace the placeholder functions in the code with the actual functions provided by the rain sensor library and the car's control system.
3. Adjust the rain level threshold (`RAIN_THRESHOLD`) to the desired value. This threshold determines when the wipers should be activated.
4. Customize the delay duration (`delay(1000)`) as needed, specifying the time between consecutive readings of the rain sensor.
5. Compile the code using a C compiler compatible with your target platform.
6. Load the compiled binary onto the self-driving car's onboard computer.
7. Execute the binary to start the rain detection and wiper control process.

```bash
$ ./rain_detection_sensor
```
