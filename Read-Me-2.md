# Advanced Rain Detection Sensor and Wiper Activation

This project demonstrates an advanced rain detection sensor and automatic wiper activation system for a self-driving car. The code provided is written in C++ and simulates the functionality of the rain sensor and wiper controller.

## Prerequisites

To run the code, you need a C++ compiler and a development environment that supports C++ development. Additionally, ensure that the necessary libraries for threading and time delays are available.

## Code Structure

The code is organized into three classes:

1. `RainSensor`: This class represents the rain detection sensor. It contains a `isRaining()` method that simulates the rain detection logic. In a real-world scenario, this method would acquire data from an actual sensor to determine if rain is detected. For simplicity, we assume that rain is detected randomly.

2. `WiperController`: This class represents the wiper controller. It contains an `activateWipers()` method that simulates the wiper activation logic. In a real self-driving car, this method would trigger the wipers to start working based on the detected rain.

3. `SelfDrivingCar`: This class combines the rain sensor and wiper controller. It has a `checkRainAndActivateWipers()` method that checks if rain is detected using the rain sensor and activates the wipers if rain is present.

The `main` function is the entry point of the program. It creates an instance of the `SelfDrivingCar` class and continuously monitors for rain by repeatedly calling the `checkRainAndActivateWipers()` method. It includes a delay of 1 second between each check to simulate real-time monitoring. You can adjust the delay as per your requirements.

## Usage

1. Ensure that you have a C++ compiler and a development environment set up.

2. Copy the provided code into a new C++ source file (e.g., `main.cpp`).

3. Compile the code using the C++ compiler. For example, using g++:

   ```bash
   g++ main.cpp -o rain_sensor_wiper_controller
   ```

4. Run the compiled executable:

   ```bash
   ./rain_sensor_wiper_controller
   ```

   The program will start monitoring for rain and display a message whenever the wipers are activated.

5. To stop the program, press `Ctrl + C` in the terminal.

## Customization

- To integrate the code with actual rain detection sensor data, replace the logic in the `isRaining()` method of the `RainSensor` class with the appropriate sensor data acquisition and processing.

- If you need to modify the wiper activation logic, update the `activateWipers()` method of the `WiperController` class according to the requirements of your wiper control system.

- Adjust the delay in the `main` function's loop to change the frequency of rain checks. For example, increase or decrease the delay time to monitor for rain more or less frequently.

## Limitations

- This code is a simplified simulation and does not include actual rain sensor data acquisition or integration with a self-driving car system. It serves as a starting point for developing such a system.

- The rain detection logic in the `RainSensor` class is randomly simulated. In a real-world scenario, you would replace it with actual sensor data acquisition and processing.

- The wiper activation logic in the `WiperController` class is a placeholder. You would need to replace it with the appropriate logic to control the wipers in your self-driving car.

## Conclusion

The advanced rain detection sensor and wiper activation system demonstrated by this code provide

 a foundation for integrating rain sensor data into a self-driving car. By customizing the rain detection logic and wiper activation logic, you can adapt the code to suit your specific requirements and hardware setup.

Feel free to modify and enhance the code to meet your needs!
